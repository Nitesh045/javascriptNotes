<-------------------------Rest Opertor------------------------>

Rest Opertor => The rest Opertor is represent by three dots (...).
             => Return value in array , when used in a function parameter list 
             => This allow functions to jandle varing numbers of arugment without explicity defining them
             => function abc(a, ...rest) {
                 return rest;
                  }

                   console.log(abc(10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5));
                       // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

function restOp(a, ...rest){
   return rest
}
console.log(restOp(5,1,2,3,4,5))
out=[1,2,3,4,5]

<------------------------Spread Operator-------------------->
Spread Operator (...):
                  The spread operator also uses three dots (...).
                  It works by taking all the items in an array (or other iterable) and spreading them out, essentially unpacking the array so that each item becomes an individual element.
                 It is like taking a bunch of items from a box and laying them out separately on a table.


function abc(a, b, c) {
    return a + b + c;
}

console.log(abc(...[1, 2, 3]));
// Output: 6

let arrSp=[1,2,34,5,6,67];
let newArrSp=[...arrSp]
console.log(newArrSp);

out=[ 1, 2, 34, 5, 6, 67 ]
